    <h1>Brownies</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, we use granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, we add these key ingredients:</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs + water</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.</li>
        <li>The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.</li>
        <li>I recommend using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!</li>
        <li>While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, we could use canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mascarpone custard layered with whipped cream and rum and coffee soaked ladyfingers.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, beat cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form.</li>
        <li>Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine coffee and rum. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with coffee mixture.</li>
        <li>Arrange half of soaked ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish. Spread half of mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers, then half of whipped cream over that. Repeat layers and sprinkle with cocoa. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours, until set.</li>
    </ol>
