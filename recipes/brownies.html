    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In order for it to turn out like (aka better than) the boxed mix, we use granulated sugar, all-purpose flour, salt, and chocolate chips. Then, we add these key ingredients:</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs + water</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Use a bit of water with the eggs to achieve the moist, gooey texture of boxed mix brownies without any commercial emulsifiers. And because this recipe doesn’t contain any baking powder, eggs are essential for helping the brownies puff up in the oven.</li>
        <li>The trick to making homemade brownies that are just like ones from a box! Powdered sugar contains cornstarch, which helps thicken the batter without the chemical additives you’d find in a mix.</li>
        <li>I recommend using Hershey’s Special Dark Dutch-processed cocoa powder (I used Whole Foods’ 365 Cocoa Powder). Make sure to sift it if it’s lumpy!</li>
        <li>While many recipes for brownies use unsalted butter, we could use canola oil, just like the boxed mix. I use olive oil because it’s what I keep on hand, and I love the rich flavor.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla really amps up the chocolate flavor.</li>
    </ol>
